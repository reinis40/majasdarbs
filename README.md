### :computer: Environment

We **highly** recommend to use Linux as OS of choice.  
If by any chance you cannot install Linux there is few tips that might help you.

**IMPORTANT!!** :boom: If you do not install Linux as your primary OS teacher & others might not be able to assist your issues regarding installation processes and other related problems.

###### [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/)

Download the latest LTS (long term support) from official Linux website.  
_You can also install Linux as secondary OS only for CODELEX._

###### Windows

In the latest windows 10 you can also install Linux as Window sub-system that allows you to use your windows in very similar way as Linux does.  
Please follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) if you decide to use Linux sub-system.

Additional option would be to use - [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)

###### MacOS

We highly recommend avoiding MacOS as it has its own eco-system. Even it is a unix system we highly recommend to use Linux for time being.
You can use "[vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)" or "[docker](https://www.docker.com/)" to utilize Linux within the MacOS.
